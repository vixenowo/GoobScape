### Description:
This is a HTTP wrapper browser made in electron and PHP with custom DNS, made to look like Windows 98 and be like the old internet. It is a silly side project for fun, dont expect anything too important

-------------------------------
## What is GoobScape
> **GoobScape is a goob:// browser written in electron.js** - used to view goob pages - technically it is just chromium because that is what electron is but this is for fun so blehhh :P

The pun is Goober + Netscape = GoobScape, if you come up with a better name let me know!

It is very basic by design (as wanting to be like the old internet) but does have features such as

- Modern HTML, CSS, JS support (as its chromium)
- Read and submit paramaters in URL with goob://
- Browsing history and saved data
- Proxy DNS support
- Interact with the browser with things such as authentication
- Supports JS for making silly pages
- Win98 program style
- Sanitized - but capable - for classic style
- Custom domains for free (using the dragonie.fun DNS)

Pages are sanitized and doesnt support back end stuff (apart from some custom things) like PHP and fancy frameworks which does create some limitations, but allows you to be creative tryna do whatever

It is designed for basic webpages - not fancy things, but you can try if you want


## What is goob://
> **goob:// is a HTTP wrapper mostly designed for old styled pages and websites** to bring back the old style of the internet

The official DNS for goob:// is managed by me and hosted on dragonie.fun

It isnt that special as its just HTTP using the dragonie.fun DNS (aka a single json file lol) but you can also do your own DNS if you want

### Goob is designed for

- No ads
- Simple functionality
- Old internet style
- Maximum silly

Use it for things such as personal pages or silly projects!

### Please note that:

- Goob:// and Goobscape is designed for silly old website projects and isnt designed for anything serious or professional
- Feel free to try things (as long as it doesnt break goob or goobscape lol)
- No support for PHP or server side - except a few exemptions
- Domains on goob:// are managed by me unless you use a proxy DNS
- I aint responsible for any proxy DNS stuff if you do use that
